# Applied Machine Learning Portfolio

I am a scientist with a background in Physics (Astrophysics), Chemistry, Statistics, and Biology,
transitioning into applied machine learning roles in environmental, health, and
biotechnology domains.

This portfolio contains end-to-end applied ML case studies using real-world public
datasets, with an emphasis on:
- noisy, imperfect scientific data
- interpretability and uncertainty
- reproducibility and clean code

## Portfolio Projects

The projects below are designed to reflect real applied-science workflows,
from data ingestion through analysis, modeling, and interpretation.

- Environmental exposure modeling using air quality and meteorological data:

### In progress
- Gene expression quality control and batch-effect analysis
- Measurement noise propagation in scientific ML models
